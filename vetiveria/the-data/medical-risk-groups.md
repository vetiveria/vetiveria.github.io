## Options for Modelling & Analysis

Scientists within the States' Environmental Protection Agency intermittently investigate the effect of the TRI programme toxic releases on  human biological systems & organs. The Agency associates each system, or organ, with a subset of the pollutants it tracks via the TRI programme, rather than all of them.  Each mapping of system/organ and pollutants can be used for focused investigations, modelling, and/or analysis, i.e., focused on a system/organ and its [posited] associated pollutants.

The [risk programs](https://github.com/vetiveria/risk) (in progress) extract the mapping details from the Agency.  The systems/organs are the

* Respiratory System
* Neurological System
* Liver
* Kidney
* Immune System

and, it also investigates risk w.r.t.

* Cancer
