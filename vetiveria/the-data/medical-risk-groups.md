## Options for Modelling & Analysis

Scientists within the United States' Environmental Protection Agency intermittently investigate the effect of the <span class="tooltip">TRI<span class="tooltiptext">Toxics Release Inventory</span></span> programme's toxic releases measurements on human biological systems & organs. The Agency associates each system, or organ, with a subset of the pollutants that are tracked via the TRI programme, rather than all of them.  Each mapping of system/organ and pollutants can be used for focused investigations, modelling, and/or analysis, i.e., focused on a system/organ and its [posited] associated pollutants.

The systems/organs are the

* Respiratory System
* Neurological System
* Liver
* Kidney
* Immune System

And, it also investigates risk <span class="tooltip">w.r.t.<span class="tooltiptext">with respect to</span></span>
