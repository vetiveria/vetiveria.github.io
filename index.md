  <figcaption>A preview.  These clusters are due to an ML clustering model based on the cumulative toxics releases values of  ~3300 U.S. counties.  The aim herein?  Investigating the intersection of clusterings, medical risks, and  the actual prevalence of the diseases/disorders associated with the medical risk groups.</figcaption>
