The focus of [vetiveria](https://github.com/vetiveria){:target="\_blank"} is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's  toxic releases data.  **After 
a few seconds an interactive three-dimensional graph will appear below**; read the caption.

  <figcaption><b>Preview.</b>  These clusters are due to an ML clustering model of cumulative toxic releases in  ~3300 U.S. counties.  It is a step towards determining whether toxic release profiles, i.e., cluster membership, are prognostic, medical risk, factors in relation to the prevalence of a disease/disorder.</figcaption>
